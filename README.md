<p align="center"><b>Discord Rich Presence intergation for mpv Media Player</b></p>
<hr><p align="center">
This is alternative version, edited from <a href="https://github.com/noaione/mpv-discordRPC">mpv-discordRPC</a>.
I add metadata tags (Title, Artist and Album) support for 'details' and I use status-line for 'state'.
I use 'elapsed' time mode when idle, while when playing, paused, and buffering use 'left' time mode.
I add support and installer script for Linux, Mac and Windows.
I also add custom configuration file and new features: info, cover art, url detections, and active/inactive toggle.

    key_toggle=D
    ```

### To use _`rpc_wrapper=lua-discordRPC`_, Important LuaJIT on mpv

Check [LuaJIT][luajit], because it has [FFI Library][ext_ffi] and it needed by
[lua-discordRPC][lua-discordRPC].

1. For Linux
    - Make sure your mpv binary linked to luajit~~ not lua~~ library.

        ```bash
        ldd $(which mpv) | grep luajit
        libluajit-5.1.so.2 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libluajit-5.1.so.2 (0x00007f32e9a83000)
        ```

    - If it's dynamic build while it's static build you can check with

        ```bash
        mpv -v -V | sed -rn 's/.*(luajit).*/\1/p'
        luajit
        ```

2. For Windows ***(Don't worry)***
   - You can skip this because available mpv Windows build by [lachs0r][lachs0r]
   and [shinchiro][shinchiro] already use LuaJIT and it static build which
   configured with `--enable-static-build`.
3. For Mac ***(So sad)***
   - Until now, LuaJIT still have problem on Mac OS X. Also build mpv with
   LuaJIT on Mac OS X (read [mpv issue #1110][mpv issue #1110]), it maybe can
   build successfully but still can't load LuaJIT properly when run mpv (read
   [mpv issue #5205][mpv issue #5205]). You can check with `otool` command.

### To use _`rpc_wrapper=python-pypresence`_, Important to install pypresence

**Support Mac, Windows, and Linux** because can use with [Lua][lua] or [LuaJIT][luajit].

1. Install [Python][python] >=3.5 because this version has [asyncio][asyncio]
library which needed by pypresence.
2. Install [pypresence][pypresence] `pip install pypresence` or `pip install
https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence/archive/master.zip` use `pip3`
instead of `pip` if Python 2 still installed on your old machine.

You may want to check again, run command `mpv -v -V` and find `luajit` or `lua`
word on the line which beginning with `[cplayer] List of enabled features:` for
Mac, Windows or Linux.

## Testing

1. Open your Discord then,
2. Open your mpv then,
